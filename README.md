# Search-Bar
This will help you create your first of MANY search bars/boxes :)


To use this CSS script, you will need to have an HTML element with a class of search-box for the search box, and an HTML element with a class of search-btn for the search button. You can then apply these styles to your search box and search button by adding the appropriate class to each element.
